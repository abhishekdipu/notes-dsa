## Big O of n => O(n) : Linear growth

- where output is linerly dependent on size of input
- algos run in linear time

- eg. a function which receives an array as input and print all it's elements

## O(n)

```js
const numbers = [];
const printAll = (numbers) => {
  for (let number of numbers) {
    console.log(number);
  }
};
```

## O(n + 2) => O(n)

```js
const numbers = [];
const printAll = (numbers) => {
  for (let number of numbers) {
    console.log(number);
  }

  console.log(numbers[0]);
  console.log(numbers[numbers.length - 1]);
};
```

## O(n + n) => O(2n) => O(n)

```js
const numbers = [];
const printAll = (numbers) => {
  for (let number of numbers) {
    console.log(number);
  }

  for (let number of numbers) {
    console.log(number);
  }
};
```

## O(n + m) => O(n)

```js
const numbers = [];
const names = [];
const printAll = (numbers) => {
  //O(n)
  for (let number of numbers) {
    console.log(number);
  }

  //O(m)
  for (let name of names) {
    console.log(name);
  }
};
```

- description
  - as size of array grows no of itteration to print grows linearly so it's time complexity is O(n)
  - O(n +- 2) = O(n) bcz if we have 1 million input then small const have not significant effect on const of algo
