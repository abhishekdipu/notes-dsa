# Binary tree :

- where nodes can have maximum 2 children

# Application of trees in real life:

- to represent hierarchical data : like employees in an organization.
- Databases : DBMS use trees for indexing.
- Autocompletion : in chrome, all previous searches are stored in tree and later used in autocompletion.
- Compiler : to parse expressions.
- Compression : compression algorithm for JPEG, MP3.

# Binary Search Tree :

- leftChild < node < rightChild

# Time Complexity

1. Lookup : O(log n)
2. Insert : O(log n)
3. Delete : O(log n)
