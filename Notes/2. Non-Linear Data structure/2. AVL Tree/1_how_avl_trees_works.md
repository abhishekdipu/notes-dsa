# How AVL Tree re-balances itself ?

- AVL Trees are special type of Binary Search Tree which automatically re-balances itself everytime we insert or remove nodes
- they do by insuring the difference between height of left sub-tree and right sub-tree is never more than 1.
- if difference is more than 1 then they re-balance themselves using rotation.

## Type of rotation

1. Left (LL)
2. Right (RR)
3. Left-Right (LR)
4. Right-Left (RL)
