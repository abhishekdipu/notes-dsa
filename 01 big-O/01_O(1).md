## big O of 1 => O(1) : constant

- algo which runs in constant time.

- eg. a function which receives an array as input and print first element

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

const getFirst = (numbers) => {
  console.log(numbers[0]);
};
```

- expaintion :
  - here output is independent of size of array.
  - if we have print 1st 10 element of array then time complexity will be O(10) = const = O(1)
