# Time complexity and Space complexity

- We evaluate the performance of an algorithm in terms of its input size
- By evaluating against the input size, the analysis is not only machine independent but the comparison is also more appropriate.

## Time complexity

- Amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size

## Space complexity

- Amount of memory taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size

## What to priorities (an algo with good time complexity or an algo with good Space complexity)?

There is no one solution that works every single time. It is always good to know multiple ways to solve the problem and use the best solution, given your constraints

- If your app needs to be very quick and has plenty of memory to work with, you don't have to worry about space complexity, in this case you should priorities **time complexity**
- If you have very little memory to work with, you should pick a solution that is relatively slower but needs less space this case you should priorities **Space complexity**

## How to represent complexity?

we make use of Asymptotic notations, it an mathematical tools to represent time and space complexity

1.  Big-O Notation (O-notation) - Worst case complexity (most important)
2.  Omega Notation (Ω-notation) - Best case complexity
3.  Theta Notation (Θ-notation) - Average case complexity
