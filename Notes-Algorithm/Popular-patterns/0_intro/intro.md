# Algorithm

- Although there are an infinite amount of potential interview problems,
- there are a finite number of underlying concepts.
- This series will be introducing the most common interview problem patterns, to give you the tools to solve ANY interview problem that comes your way.

## Some of the popular patterns are :

1. Sliding Window
   • Maximum sum of a sub-array
2. Two Pointers
   • Removing duplicates
3. Fast and Slow Pointers
   • Find a cycle in a linked list
4. Merge Intervals
   • Conflicting appointments
5. Breadth First Search
   • Binary tree level order traversal
6. Depth First Search
   • Find path with given sequence
7. Subsets
   • Permutations
8. Top "K" Elements
   • Kth smallest number
9. Dynamic Programming
   • Knapsack problem
