# Traversing Trees

- In Linear data-structure(Array/Linked-List) we have only 1 way to traverse.
- But in case of trees we have many to traverse

# Traversing BST :

1. BFS (Breadth First Search) :
   - also know as "Level Order Traversal" here we go from 1 level to next level
2. DFS (Depth First Search) :
   - 3 different ways are there
   - Pre-order : Root, Left, Right
   - In-order : Left, Root, Right
   - Post-order : Left, Right, Root

## Implementation of Tree Traversal algorithm:

- Tree Traversal can be implemented using recursion.
