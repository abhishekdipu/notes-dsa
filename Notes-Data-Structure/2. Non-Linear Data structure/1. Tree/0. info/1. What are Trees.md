# Trees

- A Tree is a data structure that stores element(data) in hierarchy
- we refer to these elements as "nodes", Each node contains some value/data which can be numbers/objects etc.
- and line that connects nodes are known as "edges"

## Root :

- top node is called root
- (height of root node) = (height of tree)
- (depth of root node) = (0)

## Leaf :

- nodes which doesn't have any children
- (height of leaf node) = 0
- (depth of leaf node) = (height of tree)

# Binary tree :

- where nodes can have maximum 2 children

# Application of trees in real life:

- to represent hierarchical data : like employees in an organization.
- Databases : DBMS use trees for indexing.
- Autocompletion : in chrome, all previous searches are stored in tree and later used in autocompletion.
- Compiler : to parse expressions.
- Compression : compression algorithm for JPEG, MP3.

# Binary Search Tree :

- leftChild < node < rightChild

# Time Complexity

1. Lookup : O(log n)
2. Insert : O(log n)
3. Delete : O(log n)
